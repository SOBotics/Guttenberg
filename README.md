## What is Guttenberg?

Guttenberg is a bot that searches for plagiarism or duplicated answers on Stack Overflow. It's currently running in [SOBotics][1] under the user [Guttenberg][2].


## Implementation

Every 60 seconds, Guttenberg fetches the most recent answers (the "targets") on Stack Overflow. For each of these answers, possibly related posts (for example answers to related questions) are collected. All those posts will be checked for different characteristics (such as the [Jaro-Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroâ€“Winkler_distance) of the posts). If at least one of the characteristics meets the requirements, a message like this will be posted in chat:

## What to do with the reports

In [this file](feedback.md), we collected information on how we react to Guttenberg's reports such as comments we leave or if and how we flag.


## Accuracy

We are aleady collecting data with [CopyPastor](https://github.com/SOBotics/CopyPastor) to provide statisctics, but since there are not that many posts to report, it will take a while until we have enough data.
